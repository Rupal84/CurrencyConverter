# Currency Converter

   This is a single page web application built in reactjs. This application offers nice UI built with *bootstrap* to perform conversion among different currencies based on conversion values maintained within application. \
   This application uses *formik* based form validations to enhance user experience. It incorporates basic validations at the moment but can be easily extended to perform more sophisticated field validations. \
   This application can perform direct, inverted and cross-over currency conversions as where direct conversion is not possible. These types of conversions use *USD/EUR* as intermediate currencies. \
  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
